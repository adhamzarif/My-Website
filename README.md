Hello, world! I'm excited to share my very first website, built from scratch using HTML and CSS. As a Computer Science student, delving into web development has been an enlightening experience. From mastering the fundamentals of HTML to applying styles with CSS, each line of code represents a step forward in my journey. This project isn't just about creating a websiteâ€”it's a reflection of my dedication to learning and exploring new technologies. Join me as I continue to expand my skills and passion for creating innovative digital solutions.
